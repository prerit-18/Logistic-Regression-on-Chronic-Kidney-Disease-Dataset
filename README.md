## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a logistic regression model to detect chronic kidney disease based on patient data. It showcases key steps in a typical machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.)

## Prerequisites
- Python (recommended version: 3.7+)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `Kidney_disease_classification_problem_PRERIT.ipynb`
2. Run each cell in order for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage
Follow the notebook steps for:
- Loading and exploring the chronic kidney disease dataset
- Training a logistic regression model
- Evaluating model accuracy and metrics

## 📊 Results & Insights
	•	Model performance: (e.g., accuracy of ~92%, precision/recall metrics)
	•	Key predictors: (such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, etc.)
	•	ROC-AUC: (e.g., 0.95, indicating strong discriminative power)
	•	Challenges: handling missing values, class imbalance, and potential overfitting
