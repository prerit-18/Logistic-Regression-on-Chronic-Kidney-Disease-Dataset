## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a logistic regression model to detect chronic kidney disease based on patient data. It showcases key steps in a typical machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature selection and engineering  
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.)
