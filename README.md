## üìå Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate a logistic regression model to detect chronic kidney disease based on patient data. It showcases key steps in a typical machine learning pipeline:

‚Ä¢ Data loading and preprocessing  

‚Ä¢ Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  

‚Ä¢ Feature selection and engineering 

‚Ä¢ Model training and hyperparameter tuning  

‚Ä¢ Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC curve, etc.)

## üìã Prerequisites
‚Ä¢ Python (recommended version: 3.7+)

‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebook

‚Ä¢ Required Python packages (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file: `Kidney_disease_classification_problem_PRERIT.ipynb`
2. Run each cell in order for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Follow the notebook steps for:
‚Ä¢ Loading and exploring the chronic kidney disease dataset

‚Ä¢ Training a logistic regression model

‚Ä¢ Evaluating model accuracy and metrics

## üìä Results & Insights
‚Ä¢	Model performance: (e.g., accuracy of ~92%, precision/recall metrics)

‚Ä¢	Key predictors: (such as blood pressure, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, etc.)

‚Ä¢	ROC-AUC: (e.g., 0.95, indicating strong discriminative power)

‚Ä¢	Challenges: handling missing values, class imbalance, and potential overfitting


## üìå Summary
‚Ä¢	Project: CKD classification using logistic regression

‚Ä¢	Highlights: Full ML pipeline from EDA to evaluation; interpretable results for healthcare prediction

‚Ä¢	Next steps: Test other models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Neural Nets), perform cross-validation, or deploy as a web app
